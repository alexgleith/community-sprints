## Spec work

This folder is where extensions and components should be proposed. Our focus is on features API, but other parts of the OGC API ecosystem are also fair game to work on. 

### Transition
It is important that the work we do in this Sprint has a transition path into standards and implementations. The OGC is developing a process for identifying, maturing, test-driving, and adopting new API modules. A description of this process is provided in PROCESS.md. Teams are encouraged to use this resource to capture both normative and informative information about what you have developed.   

### Documenting Your Solution
Developers don’t read standards. So we don’t want to give
them a massive tome which will never be read. The preferred approach for API standards is to produce a document which is concise and complete. There should be clear statements of the requirements, schema, examples, some explanatory text, and little else. Most of this content should be normative.

However, there is a lot of information which the developers may need to truly understand the standard. This non-normative information can be provided in a separate document. In API-Features it’s in the Guide. These two documents work together. The essential information in the standard and the background information in the guide.
