## Overview

One of the areas engineers most often underinvest in is communicating with the world about their work. It is a clear goal of
STAC to do this, and OGC API is starting down that path too. For this set of topics we also appreciate any brainstorming 
and creative ideas on how we can get the word out to diverse audiences more, so feel free to propose more.

### stacspec.org improvements
The STAC website is a github repo at https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-site. Tackling any of the 
[issues raised](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-site/issues) would be a great help. There are also a number of other
things that are deserving of tickets that haven't been written up yet, but would be awesome to do:

* Add more tools, see [#23](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-site/issues/23) - but ideally we should talk to everyone
at the sprint to make sure we're not missing any tools there.
* Better 'stac in action' section. There are more repositories that are up to speed that would be good to include. This should
also include hosted API instances that people are relying upon (though I think we don't want to have too many that just have
landsat in them).
* Stand up a [sat-api-browser](https://github.com/sat-utils/sat-api-browser) instance on the site, that links to some
stable API's, so people can try out the interaction.
* Put links to the JSON catalogs in STAC in action, as the hosted netlify ones aren't always staying up perfectly.
* Survey all the previous talks / podcasts that have been given on STAC and put links to them on the website. For example 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emXgkNutUTo, and then the ARD conference has also had STAC talks each year, and recorded them.

### Custom styling of STAC Browser for existing catalogs

[STAC Browser](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-browser) tends to all look the same, but it actually pretty easy to 
customize. Would be great for more examples where it looks a bit different, and even templates others could use.

### Roadmaps

People always like to know where things will evolve to. The easier one here is writing up the STAC roadmap. We used to have
the roadmap as part of the repo, but it fell out of date, and we felt the website was a better place for it. 

The more challenging one is the OGC API roadmap, but it would likely be a huge help to everyone, including potential funders,
if there's a clear, high level roadmap of what needs to be built next to fully bring about the github/openapi/json/rest 
revolution to the OGC spec baseline.

### OGC API website content

Core OGC staff may be working on some of this, but it could be good to help brainstorm good, succinct content. It also could
make sense to start with an OGC API - Features website, that eventually folds in elsewhere, but that can be very clear and
focused, following the pattern of Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF and STAC.

### Presentations

Creating the equivalent of a 'corporate deck' could be a big win - a set of great looking slides that tell the main story. 
This could be customized as needed by the presenter, but it'd be great to give people a great starting point. This is needed
for both STAC and OGC API (features and in general).

It'd also be great to brainstorm on different audiences we'd like to present to, and try to come up with a calendar of events
to hit, and a distributed set of speakers who can attend and talk. This should include podcasts and webinars.

### Tutorials / guides

Would be awesome to have more tutorial and guide type material, to get people up to speed and answer the early questions.
