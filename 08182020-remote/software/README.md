## Software STAC Sprint Aug 18+20

The 'software' portion of [STAC Sprint #6](https://medium.com/radiant-earth-insights/join-us-for-stac-sprint-6-our-first-fully-remote-event-28e118a5279c) starts
on August 18th. The event will be run completely remotely. We aim to have a 'kick-off' at [13:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=STAC+Sprint+%236+Kickoff&iso=20200818T13&p1=1440),
on the first day but we encourage you to start at the beginning of your day.

The plan is to have most of the time focused on actually working on STAC, with a few different zoom rooms open so people can collaborate and ask questions. We will
have one room that is more focused on new users, but for this part of the sprint we expect participants to be software developers who are capable of diving in, 
writing code and submitting pull requests. So the beginner session will just be a brief overview of the specification & ecosystem, and then will mostly focus
on Q&A to get people up to speed. 

## Communication

There will be two main channels of communication during the sprint.

**Gitter** for asynchronous chat. We'll start with using the main [STAC gitter room](https://gitter.im/SpatioTemporal-Asset-Catalog/Lobby), but can make additional
breakout rooms if there is a need for small group async discussions.

**Zoom** for voice/video/screensharing. The kickoff session will be on zoom. We will set up a handful of open rooms that people can choose to join, and also enable
break out zoom sessions. Planet can provide zoom rooms, but others can also just use other video tools - just post details in this repo and on the gitter channel.
